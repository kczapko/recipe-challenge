          <h2>Instructions</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat oven
              to 350°F (177°C).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Make the crust:</strong> Using a food processor, pulse the
              graham crackers into crumbs. Pour into a medium bowl and stir in
              sugar and melted butter until combined. (You can also pulse it all
              together in the food processor.) Mixture will be sandy. Press
              firmly into the bottom and slightly up the sides of a 9-inch or
              10-inch springform pan. No need to grease the pan first. I use the
              bottom of a measuring cup to pack the crust down tightly. Pre-bake
              for 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and place the hot pan on a
              large piece of aluminum foil. The foil will wrap around the pan
              for the water bath in step 4. Allow crust to slightly cool as you
              prepare the filling.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Make the filling:</strong> Using a handheld or stand mixer
              fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and
              granulated sugar together on medium-high speed in a large bowl
              until the mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the
              sour cream, vanilla extract, and lemon juice then beat until fully
              combined. On medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating
              after each addition until just blended. After the final egg is
              incorporated into the batter, stop mixing. To help prevent the
              cheesecake from deflating and cracking as it cools, avoid
              over-mixing the batter as best you can.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Prepare the simple water bath (see note):</strong> Watch
              my video tutorial above; the visual guide will assist you in this
              step! Boil a pot of water. You need 1 inch of water in your
              roasting pan for the water bath, so make sure you boil enough. I
              use an entire kettle of hot water. As the water is heating up,
              wrap the aluminum foil around the springform pan. Pour the
              cheesecake batter on top of the crust. Use a rubber spatula or
              spoon to smooth it into an even layer. Place the pan inside of a
              large roasting pan. Carefully pour the hot water inside of the pan
              and place in the oven. (Or you can place the roasting pan in the
              oven first, then pour the hot water in. Whichever is easier for
              you.)
            </li>
            <li>
              (Note: if you notice the cheesecake browning too quickly on top,
              tent it with aluminum foil halfway through baking.) Bake
              cheesecake for 55-70 minutes or until the center is almost set.
              When it’s done, the center of the cheesecake will slightly wobble
              if you gently shake the pan. Turn the oven off and open the oven
              door slightly. Let the cheesecake sit in the oven in the water
              bath as it cools down for 1 hour. Remove from the oven and water
              bath, then cool cheesecake completely at room temperature. Then
              refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours or overnight.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use a knife to loosen the chilled cheesecake from the rim of the
              springform pan, then remove the rim. Using a clean sharp knife,
              cut into slices for serving. For neat slices, wipe the knife clean
              and dip into warm water between each slice.
            </li>
            <li>
              Serve cheesecake with desired toppings. Cover and store leftover
              cheesecake in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
